[How does Prison Misconduct Affect Inmate Outcomes?](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6wbsdfzrnhj2ha9wwshuo/Caceres-Bravo-JMP-Draft.pdf?rlkey=3zcsr6p0k32px8e0mnieoxxac&st=vqh4lgws&dl=0)

Inmates in the US are sorted into different government-run facilities to serve their sentences and can face highly heterogeneous environments. I study how being sorted into different prisons affects short- and long-term inmate outcomes. Using data from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, I estimate the effect of different prisons on inmate misconduct while incarcerated, controlling for sentencing and assessment variables used to sort inmates into prisons. I validate these prison misconduct effects in two ways. First, I show balance across inmate demographics. Second, I leverage inmate transfers between prisons in a "movers" design to show these estimated misconduct effects accurately reflect prison treatment effects. Being assigned to a prison in the highest vs. the lowest decile in terms of misconduct effects would approximately double misconduct, increase additional months in prison by 9%, and increase the probability of prison reentry from a serious crime by 11%. In contrast to the existing literature, I do not find a prison's security level or demographic composition drive misconduct; instead I find over-crowding and the criminality of peers are most predictive of prison misconduct effects.

Inmates in the US are sorted into different government-run facilities to serve their sentences and can face highly heterogeneous environments. I study how being sorted into different prisons affects short- and long-term inmate outcomes. Using data from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, I estimate the effect of different prisons on inmate misconduct while incarcerated, controlling for a rich set of sentencing and assessment variables used to sort inmates into prisons. I validate my estimates in two ways. First, I show balance across inmate demographics. Second, I leverage inmate transfers between prisons in a ``movers'' design to show misconduct effects accurately reflect causal prison treatment effects. Being assigned to a prison in the highest vs. the lowest decile of misconduct effects approximately doubles misconduct, increases additional months in prison by 9%, and increases prison reentry from serious crime by 11%. Over-crowding and the criminality of peers are most predictive of misconduct effects. An assignment policy that sorts a portion of inmates into the prisons that most reduce misconduct can reduce their misconduct by up to 40%, time in prison by 4%, and reentry through serious crime by 5%.
