<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am a research assistant based in New Haven, CT. I double-majored in
mathematics and economics at the University of Utah and I have a Master's
degree in economics from Columbia University.</p>

<p>This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year.
