# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    Hi! I am a research assistant based in Cambridge, MA. I double-majored in
    mathematics and economics at the University of Utah and I have a Master's
    degree in economics from Columbia University.

    This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
    coding projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: https://mcaceresb.github.io # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
github_username: mcaceresb
medium_username: mcaceresb
