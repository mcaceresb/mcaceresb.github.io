My name is Mauricio CÃ¡ceres Bravo. I was born in Lima, Peru, and moved
to Utah when I was 17. I completed my undergraduate studies at the
University of Utah, where I double-majored in economics and mathematics.
After college I worked as a credit risk analyst for a local bank for a
year before moving to New York for graduate school. I have a Master's
degree in economics from Columbia University.

I worked as a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic
Research in Cambridge, MA, for two years, and then at the Yale School of
Management in New Haven, CT, for another two years. This fall, however,
I will be starting Brown's Economics PhD program.

This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year. However,
the idea is to eventually host a blog and all my research projects.
