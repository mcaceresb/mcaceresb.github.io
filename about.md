<!-- ![me]({{ "/assets/me/mauricio-wm-ch.jpg" | relateive_url }} "me"){:height="200px" width="200px"}. -->

My name is Mauricio CÃ¡ceres Bravo. I was born in Lima, Peru, and moved
to Utah when I was 17. I completed my undergraduate studies at the
University of Utah, where I double-majored in economics and mathematics.

After college I worked for a year as a credit risk analyst for a local
bank. Thereafter I moved to New York for graduate school. I have a
Master's degree in economics from Columbia University.

These days I'm one of the research assistants at the National Bureau
of Economic Research in Cambridge, MA. This is my personal website,
meant to force myself to speed along some projects I've had in the
back-burner throughout the past year.

Currently the site mainly points to [some of my coding projects]({{ "/coding" | relateive_url }}),
but the idea is to eventually host a blog and my personal research
projects. Having a place to publish them should encourage me
to work more consistently on them.
