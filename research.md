I am an aspiring researcher and will be joining Brown University's PhD program in the fall of 2019.

### Publications

My first discrete piece of research was an undergraduate project that was eventually published in the Southern Economic Journal.

[The effects on insurance costs of restricting undocumented immigrants’ access to driver licenses](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/soej.12022/full) (with [Kenneth P. Jameson](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~jameson)). _Southern Economic Journal_, 81, no. 4: 907–927.  
- Winner of the Southern Economic Association’s [2015 Georgescu-Roegen Prize](https://www.southerneconomic.org/the-georgescu-roegen-prize) for best academic article.

### Projects in Progress

I am currently working on a few projects in health economics and industrial organization, including:

_Mortality Effects and Choice Across Health Plans_ (with Jason Abaluck, Peter Hull, and Amanda Starc).

_What is Driving Rising Pharmaceutical Prices in the US?_ (with Craig Garthwaite and Fiona Scott Morton).

_Product Variety Across Retail Chains_ (with Kevin R. Williams and Thomas W. Quan).
