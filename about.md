Hi!

I am a research assistant based in Cambridge, MA. I double-majored in
mathematics and economics at the University of Utah and I have a Master's
degree in economics from Columbia University.

This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
coding projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year.
