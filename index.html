<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am an Economics PhD candidate at Brown University. I double-majored
in mathematics and economics at the University of Utah and I have a
Master's degree in economics from Columbia University.</p>

<p>I am an aspiring researcher and will start pursuing a PhD in
economics this fall. This is my personal website, meant to force myself
to speed along some projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the
past year.</p>
