        <p>Hi!</p>

        <p>I am a research assistant based in New Haven, CT. I double-majored in
        mathematics and economics at the University of Utah and I have a Master's
        degree in economics from Columbia University.</p>

        <p>This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
        coding projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year.
        You can also see <a href="https://mcaceresb.github.io/beta/">a fancy beta version here</a>.</p>
