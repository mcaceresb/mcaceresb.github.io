<!-- ![me]({{ "/assets/me/mauricio-wm-ch.jpg" | relateive_url }} "me"){:height="200px" width="200px"}. -->

My name is Mauricio CÃ¡ceres Bravo. I was born in Lima, Peru, and moved
to Utah when I was 17. I completed my undergraduate studies at the
University of Utah, where I double-majored in economics and mathematics.
After college I worked as a credit risk analyst for a local bank for a
year before moving to New York for graduate school. I have a Master's
degree in economics from Columbia University.

After New York I became a research assistant at the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge, MA, and I worked there for two years.
These days, however, I am working as a research assistant at the Yale
School of Management in New Haven.

This is my personal website, meant to force myself to speed along some
projects I've had in the back-burner throughout the past year (you can
find links to some of my coding projects [under the code tab]({{ "/coding" | relateive_url }})).
However, the idea is to eventually host a blog and my personal research
projects. Having a place to publish them should encourage me to work
more consistently on them.
