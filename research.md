I am an aspiring researcher and will be joining Brown University's economics PhD program in the fall of this year. I am currently working on a few projects in health economics and industrial organization. My first discrete piece of research was an undergraduate project with Professor Kenneth P. Jameson, published in the Southern Economic Journal.
