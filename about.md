I was born in Lima, Peru, and moved to Utah when I was 17. I completed my
undergraduate studies at the University of Utah, where I double-majored in
economics and mathematics.  After college I worked as a credit risk analyst
for a local bank for a year before moving to New York for graduate school. (I
have a Master's degree in economics from Columbia University.)

I'm currently also a US citizen. I've worked as a research assistant at the
National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, MA, for two years, and then
at the Yale School of Management in New Haven, CT, for another two years. I am
a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Brown University, and I'm on the 2024-2025
job market.

My hobbies include Chess, Tae Kwon-Do, and computer programming.
