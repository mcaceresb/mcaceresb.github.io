I rather like coding and created this website mainly to force myself to speed along some projects I've had in the back-burner for the past year. You can see all my projects in [my github page](https://github.com/mcaceresb).

I use a lot of [Stata](https://stata.com) these days. Here's some foo I've written that's proved useful over time:

- [stata-power](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-power): Notes and programs to do parametric and simulated power calculations.
- [stata-benchmark](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-benchmark): Simple hack to benchmark (time) Stata programs.
- [stata-todatetime](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-todatetime): Simple wrapper to convert Stata strings to date-time.
- [stata-matrix-tools](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-matrix-tools): Various utilities to work with Stata matrices.

Some other interesting projects:

- [gmail-download](https://github.com/mcaceresb/gmail-download): Download and sort all gmail e-mails into various formats using the Gmail API.
- [tablefill](https://github.com/mcaceresb/tablefill): Fill LyX and LaTeX templates (meant to help with automated table generation and updating).
- [gre-cli-words](https://github.com/mcaceresb/gre-cli-words): Show a random GRE vocab word in the command line.
- [highlight-sas-stata](https://github.com/mcaceresb/highlight-sas-stata): Various implementations highlighting SAS and Stata (pygments, listings, highlight.js)
